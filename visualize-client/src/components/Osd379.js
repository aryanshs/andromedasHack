          The Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 (RRRM-1) was designed to
          investigate the effects of spaceflight on aging and disease
          progression, using 160 female BALB/cAnNTac mice in two age groups
          (10-12 weeks and 32 weeks). Scientists conduct space missions like
          this to understand how the microgravity environment impacts biological
          systemsâ€”particularly molecular changes that occur in organs like the
          liver. These studies help researchers learn about long-term
          spaceflight risks, human health in space, and how biological
          processes, such as aging and disease, differ in space. The mission
          focused on how spaceflight and subsequent re-entry affected the liver
          at the molecular level, utilizing RNA-seq analysis to observe changes
          in gene expression. The outcomes from such studies provide critical
          data for developing countermeasures to health risks astronauts may
          face on long-duration space missions, and they can also enhance our
          understanding of diseases like osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, and
          cardiovascular dysfunction, which may be influenced by space travel.
